# Rubis Clone - New Card Form

The purpose of this project is to replicate the flow of obtaining a card from the Rubis App. This involves generating a multi-step form to collect details necessary in requesting for a new card. The process of obtaining a new card will be divided into four categories:

- Obtaining personal information
- Obtaining information on where and how the card can be used
- Selecting a pickup location
- Detail confirmation
- OTP verification
